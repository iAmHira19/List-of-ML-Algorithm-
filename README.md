## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms categorized by their learning paradigms. It serves as a reference and study guide for understanding the various algorithms used in machine learning.

## Supervised Learning Algorithms
Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled data. They are used for both regression and classification tasks.

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **Gradient Boosting Machines** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
9. **Neural Networks**

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
Unsupervised learning algorithms are used on datasets that are not labeled. These algorithms help in finding patterns or groupings within the data.

1. **K-Means Clustering**
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
5. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
6. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
7. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
8. **Apriori Algorithm**

## Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms
Semi-supervised learning algorithms use both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

1. **Label Propagation**
2. **Self-Training**
3. **Co-Training**

## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in environments where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions and receiving feedback from the environment.

1. **Q-Learning**
2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
3. **Policy Gradient Methods**
4. **Actor-Critic Methods**
5. **Monte Carlo Methods**

## Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
Dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining its important characteristics.

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
3. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
4. **Autoencoders**

## Ensemble Learning Algorithms
Ensemble learning algorithms combine multiple models to improve the performance of machine learning tasks.

1. **Bagging**
2. **Boosting** (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)
3. **Stacking**
4. **Voting Classifier**
